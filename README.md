# orst

Comparison of basic sorting implementations.

Following along with [jon gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com/)'s video [Crust of Rust: Sorting Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4RkCyJyXmM).

Not quite a fork, but a parallel version of [jon's version of the code](https://github.com/jonhoo/orst).

## Name
The name of this crate is the letters of "sort", but in the correct order.

Also note: It is empirically provable that this is not the **w**orst crate.


## Plot the data
Clone, then run `make plot`
